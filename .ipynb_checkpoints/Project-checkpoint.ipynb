    "The final task concerns the text file 'wssnt10.txt' which contains the text of William Shakespeare's Sonnets (a type of poem - these are some of the most famous in English). There are 154 sonnets, and the task is to investigate them, and in particular to decide how positive or negative each sonnet is. To that end there are two more data files 'positive-words.txt' and 'negative-words.txt' which contain lists of positive and negative words respectively. These words come from the paper *Minqing Hu and Bing Liu. \"Mining and summarizing customer reviews.\" Proceedings of the ACM SIGKDD International Conference on Knowledge Discovery & Data Mining, Seattle, Washington, USA, Aug 22-25, 2004*. So whilst the words are not ideal for our purpose (since they are mainly to do with product review sentiments), they still represent an interesting way to examine our poems.\n",
    "- You should read in all three of the data files. You will need to split the sonnets in 'wssnt10.txt' up so that each poem can be considered individually. Note each one is marked at the start by a Roman numeral.\n",
    "- You need to invent a metric for how positive or negative a poem is based on how many of the words in it are in the positive/negative word lists. For instance, is a poem containing one positive and one negative word: overall positive, negative or neutral? - try and develop a single measure based on the word occurrences that will describe the positivity/negativity of the poem.\n",
    "- Make a plot of the measure you have invented as a y-axis, with poem number as an x-axis.\n",
    "- Which is the most positive poem, and which the most negative poem? What is the text of those poems? Does your measure make sense when you look at the poems?\n",
    "- Can you use this data to answer any other questions about the data, or to compare different measures of positivity/negativity?\n",
